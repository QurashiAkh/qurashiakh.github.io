[This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUz3E9AW0w) of NetworkChuck made me actually think of having a Website. When I was about to take a Decision, I had clashing thoughts about it, merely:
- *"What if I can't maintain the Website?"*
- *"I mean.. should I even start one?"*
- *"What if I just suck at writing?"*

Overall, I found it a nice Idea, as I could share things I learn and probably get readers to benefit from it. I hope this will be a good step.  
So I just installed Jekyll, added a nice theme, wrote this and uploaded it to GitHub.

I think I'll spend my Time on here mainly writing about my previous side-Projects or similar, also the fact that I'm trying to get into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and diving deep into Low-Level Programming, I mean, I do have access to some Arduino devices I can do some technical Experiments on. Hope that'll be fun!

Anyway, I'll try to be more Active than the.. uhh.. last Website which I took down - myself - for being extremely inactive at.
