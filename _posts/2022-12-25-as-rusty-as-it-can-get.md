So, as a small Rustacean, I tried to make a small CLI program as my first Side-Project in Rust. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/qurashiakh/OS.rs).

The thing I like about Rust is how Robust it is. I recall C/C++ having similarly fast Performance, but it just feels like you're not coding with C/C++, rather just coding in your own Language you created on top of them. Rust has a rich [awesome std library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) that I can't wait to explore.

I'm willing to keep up with Rust & Go and see where they can get me, as I'm really interested in such Languages since I only coded in Python & JS so far.
