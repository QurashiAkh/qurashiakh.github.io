I've had a really long time coding in Python, especially in Python Web Development using Django and Flask.  
I really liked the Path all along, in fact, I still am coding in Flask. Web Development is something I really liked, it was my main goal to get a Website up and running with CRUD Functionality and beautiful styling (uhhh.. let's leave that right now).

I watched [this Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjiXkJ6P9pQ) by Dion Misic in PyCon Australia, it was a nice Explanation of what the next Steps of a Web Developer are.  
WebSockets are interesting, I think of them as an Integration to HTTP, and they're so easy to use - thanks to the `socket` python module.

I [began developing](https://github.com/QurashiAkh/echticka) WebSockets in February last year when I was extremely bored, doing nothing, trying to get better at JavaScript but still suck at it, and so on. [Echticka](https://github.com/QurashiAkh/echticka) was the start and the end for that Time, since I sort-of left the Project for over two years with no commits or pushes.

Today, I decided to go back to that repo, and I found a large ton of bugs, mainly because of how I used to write code back then. I've done some Improvements to Echticka in my last Commit as I'm willing to make it the best CLI Communications App. It's still in Alpha right now, we'll see what'll come.
